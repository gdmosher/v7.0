Sample: Simple Direct3D9 (Vertex Arrays)
Minimum spec: SM 2.0

Simple program which demonstrates interoperability between CUDA and Direct3D9. The program generates a vertex array with CUDA and uses Direct3D9 to render the geometry.  A Direct3D capable device is required.

Key concepts:
Graphics Interop
